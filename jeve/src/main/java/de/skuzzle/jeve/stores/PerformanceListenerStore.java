/**
 * Extension to the {@link DefaultListenerStore} which offers to enable higher
 * {@link #get(Class)} performance. The higher performance is achieved at the
 * cost of lowering the performance of {@link #remove(Class, Listener)} and
 * {@link #add(Class, Listener)}. The public interface to this store is thread
 * safe.
 *
 * <p>
 * Most applications have something like a setup phase in which listeners are
 * registered. After this phase, the listener store is rarely modified anymore,
 * but events will be fired frequently from now on. If this reflects your usage
 * scenario, this {@linkplain ListenerStore} implementation can offer higher
 * runtime performance.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * After instantiation, this store behaves exactly like the
 * {@link DefaultListenerStore}. After the registration phase of your
 * application is finished, you may call {@link #optimizeGet()} on this store.
 * This will replace all regular Lists which are used to store different
 * listeners with {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList CopyOnWriteArrayLists}. This
 * reduces the need to copy the list of retrieved Listeners upon
 * {@link #get(Class)}. The cost of copying is thereby moved to the
 * {@link #add(Class, Listener)} and {@link #remove(Class, Listener)} methods.
