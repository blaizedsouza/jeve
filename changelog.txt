This is the jeve version history.
Author: Simon Taddiken

Version 2.0.0 [Released: TODO]
    * Remove 'listenerClass' parameter from EventProvider#dispatch. Each Event 
      instance now specifies the class of the listener which can handle it.
    * Reintroduced 'EventProviders' class and moved factory methods there.
    * Removed deprecated method 'workDone' from the Listener interface
    * Corrected semantics of AbortionException: those will be delegated up to 
      the caller of EventProvider#dispatch and will no longer be passed to the
      ExceptionCallback when thrown by a listener.

Version 1.1.0 [Released: 04.06.2014]
    * Added ParallelEventProvider which notifies each listener within an own
      thread.
    * Deprecated Listener#workDone(EventProvider) in favor of manual removal
      of listeners
    * Added annotation @ListenerInterface and AnnotationProcessor which checks
      whether your listeners adhere to the default style of listener interfaces
    * Added AbortionException as a way to brutally stop event delegation

Version 1.0.0 [Released: 21.04.2014]
    * initial API and implementation
